# Employee Management System - Backend

## üöÄ **Overview**

This is the **backend** for the Employee Management System. It is built with **ASP.NET API** and manages the application's core data and business logic. 
The backend exposes endpoints to handle CRUD operations for the following entities:
- **Role**
- **Designation**
- **Employee**
- **Client**
- **Project**

The entities are relationally mapped to allow effective management:
- Each **Project** has a lead (**Employee**) and is assigned to a **Client**.
- Each **Employee** is assigned a **Designation** and a **Role**.
- An **Employee** can work on one or more projects, but only one **lead** exists per project.

This backend works with the frontend project, built in **Angular**. Find it [here](https://github.com/Nourhan123Essam/Employee-Management-System-Angular).
