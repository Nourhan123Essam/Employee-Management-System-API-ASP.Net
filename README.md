# Employee Management System - Backend

## üöÄ Overview

The **Employee Management System Backend** is built using **ASP.NET Core API** and handles core data and business logic for managing employees, roles, designations, clients, and projects. This API enables seamless CRUD operations with real-world relational mappings.

### Key Entity Relationships:
- Each **Project** is led by an **Employee** and assigned to a **Client**.
- Each **Employee** has a specific **Designation** and **Role**.
- An **Employee** can work on multiple **Projects**, but only one **Lead Employee** exists per project.
- Deleting a **Client** automatically removes all related **Projects**.
